### Integration

The lib **soon will be available** on Maven Central.

```
dependencies {
    // replace x.x.x with version number
    compile 'com.github.dmytrodanylyk.android-process-buton:library:x.x.x'
}
```

Currently you need to import library module to your project or use snapshot.

```
repositories {
        maven { url "https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/" }
        mavenCentral()
}
```

```
dependencies {
    compile 'com.github.dmytrodanylyk.android-process-buton:library:0.0.2-SNAPSHOT'
